/**
    Logs App's state transition
 
 ## Important Notes ##
 1. Logger is a singleton class
 2. Uses DEBUG target to enable/disable logging
 3. UIApplication.State has extension CustomStringConvertible
 
 ### Usage Example: ###
 
 ```
 let logger = StateLogger.shared
 logger.printInfo(about: #function)
 
 logger.appStateTransitionInfo(#function, "some state")
 
 ```

        Function of logging current state's transition information
     ## Important Notes ##
     
     Method understands if the calling function has "Will" in it's name and
     automaticly makes a decision about current state of the App.
